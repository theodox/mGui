    Illustrates the basics of binding to a list.  The collection 'bound' contains some strings, and we
    bind it to the VerticalList 'list_view'.

    Adding items to the collection automatically redraws the list with the new items. In this case they are
    drawn with buttons, but lists allow you to customize the appearance of items extensively.

    This example also illustrates how to use closures to capture inter-object references, and how to keep callback
    functions alive without creating a full class.
